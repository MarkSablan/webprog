			<h3>Mark Luis Guerrero Sablan</h3>
			<h4>July 10, 1997</h4>
			<h4>Aspiring programmer</h4>

			<p>
				I was born in July 10 1997 at the city of Baguio, Benguet. My mother's name is Alma Guerrero Sablan and my father's name is Leonardo Tolentino Sablan. I am the youngest of the siblings of four. Through the years, our family resided in so many places, firstly in Baguio City then in Calamba City,Laguna after that in Pasig City and currently in Cainta,Rizal. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I started Elementary in Baguio City at 2004 and finished it at 2010. After that, I studied highschool in Pasig City and graduated last 2015.Currently I am a third year student in STI Ortigas-Cainta whose taking Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology. BSIT was not my first choice because my dream is to become a pilot and been wanting to fly an aircraft since I was young. But because of lack of funds, I wasn't able to take an aviation course. I took BSIT course in STI Ortigas-Cainta because of the recomendation of my auntie and cousin who graduated in the same school and same course with High Honors and also been able to become an IT instructor.

				Though the course that I took was not really my preference, I was able to cope up with the things that we tackle in this industry. I learned so much about technical things and was able to apply these knowledge to the actual world. I found it amazing to write a code and to build an application, website, and computer system. And because of these reasons, I devoted myself to become a developer and to become a part of an IT team in the actual industry to be able to contribute something in the community.
